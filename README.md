# Kolosseumi

This repository contains the source code for **Kolosseumi**, a small experimental game project developed during **[SGH Talvijami 2026](https://itch.io/jam/sgh-talvijami-2026)**. The project is left public **for documentation, reference, and learning purposes only**. Development has been discontinued and no further updates are planned.

The final playable build is available for download [here](https://pingku.itch.io/kolosseumi).

## Project Overview

Kolosseumi was created as a **tournament management and simulation prototype**, focusing on preparation-driven gameplay rather than direct control. The project explores how strategic decisions made before a match affect outcomes in an autonomous combat simulation.

From a development perspective, the project includes:
- **Rough UI** for hiring new gladiators, starting matches and reading text-based events
- **Formation setup phase** where units are positioned before combat
- **Arena simulation loop** where combat resolves without player input
- Basic **AI-controlled unit behavior** and match resolution logic
- **Minor systems**, such as tracking player money, randomly generating rosters for opposing teams, etc.

The project draws inspiration from **Seppo Suorsa's classic Areena games**.

## Scope and Limitations

- The project was developed under **game jam constraints**, resulting in:
  - Hardcoded systems
  - Limited abstraction
  - Minimal tooling and polish
- The codebase prioritizes **getting a playable prototype running** over long-term maintainability.
- **Localization was not implemented** — all in-game text is Finnish-only.
- The project should not be considered production-ready.

## Repository Status

⚠️ **Archived / Discontinued**

This repository is no longer actively developed. It is published to:

- Preserve the project as a snapshot of the jam build
- Serve as a reference for similar prototype-scale systems
- Document design and technical decisions made under time constraints

Feel free to browse, fork, or reference the code, but expect rough edges and unfinished systems.
